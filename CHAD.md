# Chad Award
### The challenge
Make the most silliest or funniest line of rust code you can. This may seem like an odd challenge but I want everyone to have the chance to be a CHAD! 

### Rules:
You can have as many lead up statements as you need.
It must compile and run.
It must have some use... it could be as simple as adding to numbers but it has to do something....
You can submit it as one line or multiple for ease of viewing.

### Examples:

//This turns every single word to the word "CHAD"
```
fn main() {

    //This turns every word in a given sentance or string to the word "üçû".
    let i = "this is a totally normal sentance.";
    println!("Sentance Before: {}", i);

    // my one line! (it does not have to print, you can do that after your line)
    println!("Sentance after: {}",i.split(" ").map(|_x| "üçû ").into_iter().collect::<String>());
}
```

### Voting:
All of your peers will get to vote on who did the best, and first place will be the gigachad and second place will be the chad. 

### Submissions:
Put your code in a a block in the __discord channel__ along with your name. Due by 1550 so we have time to vote!
